ABSTRACT : Windshield wipers play a key role during adverse weather conditions by wiping the rain continuously over the windshield area and provides a clear vision to the driver. Wipers are designed and made to clear the water from a windscreen.. It is very important to improve the safety facility in an automobile vehicles .The system used to activate the wiper operation manually.Due to this, many researchers have contributed to research and development on smart wind shield wiper mechanism in automotive. Considering that, the current work compiles a compilation of articles reviewed on smart wind shield wipermechanism from year 1903 to 2015. The windshield wiper system of passenger cars comprises three major subsystems: two wipers and their arms; a mechanism; and an electric motor.The concept of this proposed wiper system is similar with other existing conventional wiper.A wiper generally consists of a metal arm; one end pivots, the other end has a long rubber bladeattached to it.In the research process The automated rain wiper system is used to detect rainfall and activate automobile rain wiper automatically without driver interaction. Finally the purpose of the project to design the winshield wiper control system for safety ness of the peoples to drive car,bus,truck...etc.
